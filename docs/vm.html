For the purposes of this workshop we have designed a target language that captures some essential concepts for a musical live coding context, such as playing notes and looping patterns. It is intentionally limited to make it fairly easy to learn, yet also intentionally designed to make it possible to express a wide variety of ideas. It is *not* designed to be succinct -- that's the job of the user-facing language you create! The target language is a bit like the instruction sequences real compilers use, in that it is a list of commands. However ours can also have nested structures as lists of lists. A simple example is a pattern that plays a note every beat:

**Click on any of the code samples below to hear them!**

```javascript
["@loop", ["@pluck", [1, "@wait"]]]
```

<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

<div id="toc"></div>

**Click on any of the code samples below to hear them!**

## Sounds

The VM comes with a small number of instruments to get things going. Here's a plucked string instrument. There are two ways to trigger it. You can use @pluck-note to set the frequency and amplitude for each note like this:

```javascript
[440, 1, "@pluck-note"]
```
```javascript
[220, 0.25, "@pluck-note"]
```
Or you can set the frequency and amplitude as contextual variables, and just use @pluck to trigger using these values. This can allow a bit more flexibility in how these values are calculated:

```javascript
["@pluck"]
```
```javascript
[[330, "@set-freq"], [0.5, "@set-amp"], "@pluck"]
```
There are also some percussion sounds, which either grab amplitude from the context (set using @set-amp), or specify it using the -note variants:

```javascript
[1, "@hat-note"]
```
```javascript
[1, "@kick-note"]
```
```javascript
[1, "@snare-note"]
```

```javascript
[[1, "@set-amp"], "@hat"]
```
```javascript
[[1, "@set-amp"], "@kick"]
```
```javascript
[[1, "@set-amp"], "@snare"]
```
```javascript
[4, "@repeat", [
	[["@iter", [0.3, 1]], "@set-amp"], 
	8, "@repeat", ["@hat", 0.125, "@wait"]
]]
```
## Repetition and parallelism

A list with several events normally happens at the same time:

```javascript
[
	[220, "@set-freq"], "@pluck", 
	[330, "@set-freq"], "@pluck"
]
```

Unless you add a n,@wait:

```javascript
[
	[220, "@set-freq"], "@pluck", 
	1, "@wait",
	[330, "@set-freq"], "@pluck"
]
```
Here's how to do something a specific number of times:

```javascript
[
	4, "@repeat", [ "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait" ]
]
```
```javascript
[
	4, "@repeat", [ "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait" ],
	[220, "@set-freq"], "@pluck"
]
```
Here's how to do something forever:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait" ]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

Note that @loop will run the pattern that follows it *in parallel*, which means that you can keep on triggering more things after it. So it's easy to set up a bunch of parallel processes:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 0.5, "@kick-note", 2, "@wait" ],
	"@loop", [ 0.3, "@hat-note", 0.4, "@wait" ],
	"@loop", [ 550, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.6, "@wait" ],
	"@loop", [ 330, 0.4, "@pluck-note", 0.2, "@wait" ],
	"@loop", [ 110, 1, "@pluck-note", 12, "@wait" ]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>


And to run something in parallel without looping it, just use @fork []:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		"@kick", 
		"@fork", [
			0.25, "@wait", 
			550, 1, "@pluck-note",
			0.33, "@wait", 
			660, 1, "@pluck-note"
		],
		1, "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>


This is also handy for setting up loops with different start times:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", ["@kick", 1, "@wait"],
	"@fork", [0.5, "@wait", 
		"@loop", ["@hat", 1, "@wait"]
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>


## Expressions

Anywhere that a number would go, you can insert an expression. Here are some fun expressions.

Here's picking a value at random from a list, instead of giving the freq and amp values as numbers:


```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		["@pick", [330, 440, 550, 660]], 
		["@pick", [1, 0.7, 0.4]],
		"@pluck-note",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

Here's alternating between a set of values in a list, one at a time:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		["@iter", [330, 440, 550, 660]],
		["@iter", [1, 0.7, 0.4]],
		"@pluck-note",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

Here's way to set the probability of something happening. Note that two lists have to be given after the "@chance"; either the first is run (if the chance happens), else the other one will be run. 

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [
		"@fork", [ 
			0.1, 
			"@chance",
			["@snare"],
			["@kick"]
		],
		"@hat", 0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>


If you don't care about the 'else' case, just put an empty list ```[]``` or ```null```. But you must put something, or else the virtual machine will get corrupted, and who knows what might happen.

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [
		"@fork", [ 
			0.1, 
			"@chance",
			["@snare"],
			[]
		],
		"@hat", 0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

Another way of getting some randomness is to use the @rand (which generates a number between 0 and 1), @srand (which generates a number between -1 and 1), and n,@randi (which generates a number between 0 and n-1):

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		"@rand", "@set-amp",
		"@pluck",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		"@pluck",
		[3, "@randi"], "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

There are several basic math functions that can be used to map numbers into useful ranges. Note that most math functions require the arguments first, e.g. use ```[a,b,@+]``` to add a and b:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		[[[4, "@randi"], 1, "@+"], 110, "@*"], "@set-freq",
		"@pluck",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		[["@srand", 10, "@*"], 110, "@+"], "@set-freq",
		"@pluck",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```
<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

## Get, set, and let

The @set-freq etc. are really just examples of creating named values ("variables") that can be re-used again later. Actually you can use @set-*anything* to create whatever variables you like, and use @get-*anything* to retrieve them. Mainly this is useful when you want to re-use something a few times:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [ 
		[[[4, "@randi"], 2, "@+"], 110, "@*"], "@set-f",
		"@get-f", 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		["@get-f", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```

<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

By default @set-*anything* will apply globally, so you can modulate a parameter from one loop while using it in another:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [
		[[[4, "@randi"], 2, "@+"], 110, "@*"], "@set-f",
		1, "@wait"
	],
	"@loop", [ 
		"@get-f", 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		["@get-f", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```

<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

If globalism isn't what you care for, you can make a name "local" to a particular loop by using @let-*anything*. Once you have @let- a variable in a particular @loop (or @fork) pattern, it will remain local to that pattern. Generally, use @let if you want some value that is only used within a pattern, and @set if you want something global. 

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [
		[[[4, "@randi"], 1, "@+"], 110, "@mul"], "@let-f",
		"@get-f", 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		["@get-f", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		0.25, "@wait"
	],
	"@loop", [
		[[[4, "@randi"], 5, "@+"], 110, "@mul"], "@let-f",
		"@get-f", 1, "@pluck-note",
		["@get-f", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
		0.25, "@wait"
	]
]
```

<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

One use for this is to repeatedly modify a value, such as for a counter, or a decay:

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [
		1, "@let-a",
		8, "@repeat", [
			"@get-a", "@snare-note",
			0.25, "@wait",
			["@get-a", 0.6, "@*"], "@set-a"
		]
	]
]
```

<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

The only thing special about @set-freq is that the name "freq" is used by @pluck. That is, @pluck is equivalent to: ```["@get-freq", "@get-amp", "@pluck-note"]```. Similarly for @set-amp etc.

## Independently parallel

Say you want to be able to launch a loop, then let it keep running while you launch another. And say you want to redefine it while it plays, or stop it. To do that you need to name it. We can do that via "@spawn".

```javascript
[
	"foo", "@spawn", [220, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.50, "@wait"],
	"bar", "@spawn", [330, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.75, "@wait"],
	3, "@wait",
	"foo", "@spawn", [110, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 1, "@wait"]
]
```

```javascript
[
	"foo", "@spawn", [440, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.5, "@wait"]
]
```

```javascript
[
	"bar", "@spawn", [110, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 1, "@wait"]
]
```
```javascript
[
	"foo", "@stop"
]
```

```javascript
[
	"bar", "@stop"
]
```




<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

```javascript
[
	"@loop",[
		"@iter",[0.01,0.2,0.01],"@hat-note",
		"@iter",[1,3],8,"@div","@wait"
	],
	"@loop",[
		["@iter",[14,15,16,17,18],44,"@mul"],"@set-freq",
		0.1,"@set-amp",
		"@pluck",
		"@pick",[5,7],32,"@div","@wait"
	],
	"@loop",[
		["@iter",[16,6,15,5,10,4,12],44,"@mul"],"@set-freq",
		1,"@pick",[2,3,5,6,5,6,5],"@div","@set-amp",
		"@pluck",
		"@iter",[5,1,9,1],32,"@div","@wait"
	]
]
```

<button class="button-primary" onclick="seq.clear()">Stop</button>

## Sending out over a websocket

There is also a command for sending data out over a websocket. By default the browser will try to connect to "ws://localhost:8080/", and if it can, it will use timing from the external source.

```javascript
[
	"@loop", [
		"pluck", "@iter", [["@iter", [440, 330]], 220, 165], "@ws-2",
		0.25, "@wait"
	],
	"@loop", [
		"@iter", ["kick", "snare"], "@ws-1",
		0.75, "@wait"
	]
]
```

## Reference

Here are all the important concepts supported and how to format them in the target code:

Concept 						| Format 
:--- 							| :---
Do nothing						| ```null```
A pattern to do three things	| ```[first, second, third]```
Wait for n beats 				| ```n, "@wait"```
Repeat n times					| ```n, "@repeat", pattern-to-loop```
Fork a pattern in parallel		| ```"@fork", pattern-to-play```
Fork a pattern to loop forever	| ```"@loop", pattern-to-loop```
Fork (or replace) a loop with a name | ```name, "@spawn", pattern```
Stop a forked loop with a name 	| ```name, "@stop"```
Pick random item to execute		| ```"@pick", pattern-of-items-to-pick-from```
Cycle through items to execute	| ```"@iter", pattern-of-items-to-alternate```
Conditional execution 			| ```condition, "@cond", executed-if-true, executed-if-false```
Probabilistic execution			| ```probability, "@chance", executed-if-true, executed-if-false```
Set beats per minute (global)	| ```n, "@bpm"```
Get current time (in beats)		| ```"@time"```
Duplicate item (so you can use it twice) | ```item, "@dup"```
Print to console				| ```message, "@print"```
Get value of *x*				| ```@get-x```
Set value of *x* (global)		| ```@set-x```
Set value of *x* (local)		| ```@let-x```

Some named values have special meaning; "freq" and "amp" are used by the sound instruments, for example.

"@rate"

Math / logic concept 			| Format 
:--- 							| :---
random integer from 0 to n-1	| ```n, "@randi"```
random number from 0 to 1		| ```n, "@rand"```
random integer from -1 to 1		| ```n, "@srand"```
a + b							| ```a, b, "@add"``` or ```a, b, "@+"```
a - b							| ```a, b, "@sub"``` or ```a, b, "@-"```
a * b							| ```a, b, "@mul"``` or ```a, b, "@*"```
a / b							| ```a, b, "@div"``` or ```a, b, "@/"```
a % b	 (Euclidean)			| ```a, b, "@wrap"``` or ```a, b, "@%"```
a % b	 (Floored)				| ```a, b, "@mod"```
-a								| ```a, "@neg"```
map n from (x,y) to (u,v)		| ```n, x, y, u, v, "@map"```
a > b							| ```a, b, "@>"``` 
a >= b							| ```a, b, "@>="```
a < b							| ```a, b, "@<"``` 
a <= b							| ```a, b, "@<="```
a == b							| ```a, b, "@=="``` 
a != b							| ```a, b, "@!="```
a and b							| ```a, b, "@and"``` 
a or b							| ```a, b, "@or"``` 
not a							| ```a, "@not"``` 

Note: division, modulo or wrap by zero will return zero.

There are only a limited number of built-in sounds, for convenience:

Sound				 			| Format 
:--- 							| :---
string							| ```freq, amp, @pluck-note``` or ```@pluck```
bass							| ```freq, amp, @bass-note``` or ```@bass```
conga							| ```freq, amp, @conga-note``` or ```@conga```
tom								| ```freq, amp, @tom-note```   or ```@tom```
kick							| ```amp, @kick-note```  or ```@kick```
snare							| ```amp, @snare-note``` or ```@snare```
hat								| ```amp, @hat-note```   or ```@hat```

There are several instructions for talking to external applications.

Message:						| Format
:--- 							| :---
MIDI note						| ```pitch, velocity, channel, duration, @note```
MIDI note on					| ```pitch, velocity, channel, @note-on```
MIDI note off					| ```pitch, velocity, channel, @note-off```
MIDI controller					| ```controller, value, channel, @cc```
Send n arguments over websocket	| ```arg1, arg2..., "@ws-n"```
